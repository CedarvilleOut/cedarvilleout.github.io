# About Cedarville Out
# Cedarville Out is comprised of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans*, and queer (LGBTQ), other sex- and gender-nonconforming, and allied alumni of Cedarville University. 
Cedarville Out is committed to providing a safe and welcoming place for current students, alumni, and faculty/staff (current and former) who have questions about their sexual orientation and those who support them. We were drawn together to create a safe place for everyone from the Cedarville community to work out their sexuality and gender without fear or reprisal. Most of us still identify as Christian and are joined in our belief that God made us gay and that being gay is not a sin. Instead of a burden or a struggle, we see our and everyone's sexuality as a gift.

# This web site is meant to reach out to those of us who are part of the Cedarville University community. 
As witnessed by our stories, our journeys have brought us to this group in various ways. We know what it is like to feel the pressure to be like everyone else. We know what it feels like to hide feelings and hope that no one knows what is going on inside. We know what it is like to feel so lonely and discouraged that it seems like life is unbearable. We know the fear of "outing" and the difficulties that may ensue. We know it is not easy and we know about the pain. That is why we are here: to provide a place to talk about your and our journeys.

# Cedarville Out is not about trying to make you gay or trying to take your faith from you. 
This is a process we worked through, and in many ways, are still working through. We invite you to read through the other pages of our site, including our stories, and email us if you like. We are here to listen and to share how we have journeyed through some very difficult and yes, joyful times. We want you to know that you are not alone. We know what it is like to feel that someone doesn't understand this journey. No matter how dark it gets, no matter how much pain there is inside, there is still great hope for joy.
